# Shopping-cart
It is a mobile shop cart. The user will select the product and the quantity. The price will be automatically updated. The user can also download the invoice in pdf.Here I have used HTML2Pdf converter. html2pdf.js converts any webpage or element into a printable PDF entirely client-side using html2canvas and jsPDF.
